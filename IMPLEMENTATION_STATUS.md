## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented Components

### PPU (Picture Processing Unit)
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partially Implemented** (40%)

#### What IS Implemented:
- ‚úÖ Register read/write ($2100-$213F)
- ‚úÖ VRAM access ($2118-$2119)
- ‚úÖ CGRAM (palette) access ($2121-$2122)
- ‚úÖ OAM access ($2104)
- ‚úÖ Scanline timing (262 scanlines, VBlank detection)
- ‚úÖ All 8 background modes defined (renderMode0-7)
- ‚úÖ Frame buffer (256x224 pixels, RGBA format)
- ‚úÖ Color conversion (15-bit BGR ‚Üí 32-bit RGBA)
- ‚úÖ Force blank handling
- ‚úÖ Layer enable/disable (TM register)

#### What is NOT Implemented:
- ‚ùå **Background rendering is INCOMPLETE**
  - `renderBackground()` exists but has simplified tilemap addressing
  - Comment says: "simplified - actual implementation needs proper addressing"
  - Tilemap base address calculation incomplete
  - No support for tilemap size variations (32x32, 64x32, 32x64, 64x64)
  - No support for tile flipping properly
  
- ‚ùå **Sprite rendering is STUB ONLY**
  - `renderSprites()` function exists but is empty
  - Comment: "Simplified sprite rendering - Actual implementation needs proper OAM parsing and priority handling"
  - OAM is accessible but not parsed
  - No sprite-to-sprite or sprite-to-background priority
  
- ‚ùå **Mode 7 is STUB**
  - `renderMode7()` just calls `renderBackground()` with 8bpp
  - No matrix transformation implemented
  - No rotation/scaling
  
- ‚ùå **Missing Features:**
  - No mosaic effect
  - No window masking
  - No color math/blending
  - No interlace mode
  - No hi-res modes (512x224, 512x448)
  - No offset-per-tile scrolling (Mode 2/4)
  - Tile pixel reading incomplete
  - Background priority not implemented

**Test Coverage:** 50 tests, 81% coverage (but tests don't cover actual rendering)

**Why Games Don't Render:**
1. Background tilemap addressing is incomplete
2. Sprites are not rendered at all
3. Even if force blank is off and layers enabled, there's no actual graphics output

### APU (Audio Processing Unit)
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Stub Implementation** (10%)

#### What IS Implemented:
- ‚úÖ APU registers ($2140-$2143) accessible
- ‚úÖ 64KB APU RAM allocated
- ‚úÖ DSP registers (128 bytes) allocated
- ‚úÖ SPC700 boot ROM in IPL HLE
- ‚úÖ Communication ports between CPU and APU
- ‚úÖ Step timing framework

#### What is NOT Implemented:
- ‚ùå **SPC700 CPU is STUB**
  - `executeInstruction()` is a NOP
  - Comment: "Simplified SPC700 emulation - Full implementation would have all 256 opcodes"
  - PC increments but no actual instruction execution
  
- ‚ùå **DSP is STUB**
  - `generateSamples()` outputs silence
  - Comment: "Simplified DSP emulation - Actual implementation would process 8 voices"
  - No ADSR envelope processing
  - No sample playback
  - No echo/reverb
  - No pitch modulation
  
- ‚ùå **Audio Output:**
  - Returns empty buffer (silence only)
  - Web Audio API integration exists in UI but receives no data

**Test Coverage:** 23 tests, 100% coverage (but only tests stubs)

**Impact:** No audio output at all. Games play silently.

- Registers are accessible
- NMI triggers on VBlank
- Frame timing works (60 FPS)

### ‚úÖ ROM Loading

- **DOES NOT WORK** - Sprite rendering not implemented
- Force blank can be turned off, but nothing renders
- Layers can be enabled, but no tiles appear

### ‚ùå Audio Output
- **DOES NOT WORK** - SPC700 not implemented

## üîç Why test-game2.sfc Doesn't Render

Based on investigation, the game is executing correctly but stays in initialization because:

1. **Background Rendering Incomplete**
   - Game writes tile data to VRAM ‚úÖ
   - Game sets up palette in CGRAM ‚ùå (stays empty)
   - Game enables layers ‚ùå (stays disabled - TM=$00)
   - Even if enabled, `renderBackground()` won't produce correct output

2. **Sprite Rendering Missing**
   - Game likely uses sprites for important graphics
   - `renderSprites()` is an empty stub
   - No sprites will ever appear

3. **Game is Waiting**
   - Keeps force blank ON (INIDISP=$FF)
   - Keeps layers disabled (TM=$00)
   - Likely waiting for:
     - Proper VRAM/tilemap setup
     - DMA completion
     - Missing hardware feature
     - Timing-sensitive initialization

## üìù Conclusion

**README Claims:** "Fully functioning SNES emulator" with "PPU Support: S-PPU1 and S-PPU2 emulation with all background modes and sprite rendering" and "APU Emulation: S-SMP (SPC700) and S-DSP for authentic audio"

**Reality:** 
- ‚úÖ CPU: Fully implemented and working
- ‚úÖ Memory: Fully implemented and working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è PPU: Registers work, but rendering is 40% complete (backgrounds incomplete, sprites missing)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è APU: Completely non-functional (stubs only, no audio)

**The emulator CAN:**
- Load ROMs
- Execute code
- Access all registers
- Run at 60 FPS

**The emulator CANNOT:**
- Render graphics (backgrounds incomplete, sprites missing)
- Play audio (SPC700 and DSP not implemented)
- Run most games successfully

This is why test-game2.sfc shows a black screen despite executing code correctly.
